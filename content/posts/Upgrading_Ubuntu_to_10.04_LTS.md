#Upgrading Ubuntu to version 10.04 LTS



I have one laptop here(mjolnir), that I'm using for my work. I installed them ~2years ago, with an Ubuntu system, because it simply worked. I tried debian, but it didn't support all the hardware.



I did an upgrade to 9.* once and it worked quite well. Ubuntu has an Dist-Upgrade-Application, that does all the stuff for you.



When Ubuntu 10 was released, I tried the same again, but because in the meantime I installed some 3rd-party Software, I couldn't upgrade the system without conflicts.

Because I didn't have the time to analyze these, I postponed the upgrade.



Today I started it again, and I found out, which Applications issued the conflicts. I removed them and now the upgrade is running. ~3h still left
