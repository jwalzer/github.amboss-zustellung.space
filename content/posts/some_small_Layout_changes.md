title: some small Layout changes
---


*This is not interesting for visitors, that are using a feedreader*

I took the time to fix the pagetemplate so that in the layout the footer is seemless again.
Also I changed the Font-Descriptions in the stylesheet, so that the reader can decide which fonts to use for rendering, because I only defined: "sans-serif" and no longer a specific typeface.
Whats still annoying me is the search-inputbox at the top, thats hanging there around... I'll fix that later...
