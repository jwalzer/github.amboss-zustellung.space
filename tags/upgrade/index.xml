      <description>#Upgrading Ubuntu to version 10.04 LTS
I have one laptop here(mjolnir), that I&amp;rsquo;m using for my work. I installed them ~2years ago, with an Ubuntu system, because it simply worked. I tried debian, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t support all the hardware.
I did an upgrade to 9.* once and it worked quite well. Ubuntu has an Dist-Upgrade-Application, that does all the stuff for you.
When Ubuntu 10 was released, I tried the same again, but because in the meantime I installed some 3rd-party Software, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t upgrade the system without conflicts.
Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to analyze these, I postponed the upgrade.
Today I started it again, and I found out, which Applications issued the conflicts. I removed them and now the upgrade is running. ~3h still left</description>
