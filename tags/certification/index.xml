      <description>This Blog is now available via IPv6 The Badge You might have realized the button on the left side of the Blog (if you&amp;rsquo;re not reading via RSS-Feed)
Here is the full-size image:
The Reason I just took the chance, to put an AAAA-Record for wa.lzer.net and took the certification on HE.net(Hurrican-Electric) and even an reverse PTR-Record. A friend reminded me of the HE-certification.
The questions you have to answer are not tooo hard, if you worked a bit with IPv6 before. Hardest part for me was to supply an IPv6-Mailserver below my domain, because my email is handled by the provider at the moment. But another friend just supplied me with one, and I could redirect a subdomain simply to his mailserver.
The uggly part Because of the existing IPv4-Setup, I now have the situation, that the HTTPS-Server is available per IPv4 on Port 1443 while now on IPv6 it is available on 443 &amp;hellip; so, if you can reach https://wa.lzer.net you have IPv6 &amp;hellip;</description>
